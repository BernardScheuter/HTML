                <br>Interwebs:\user\Bernard\day9&gt;ls
                <br>
                <br>Listing of today:
                <br>- Figured out that you can't use grouping elements in a paragraph.... so no list in a paragraph... to bad.
                <br>- Experimented with forms, but no link to PHP/MySQL yet
                <br>- Fixed a lot of formatting issues
                <br>- Removed a lot of "code leftovers"
                <br>- Decided to stop using a lot of "a lot"
                <br>- discovered how usefull the "inspect" option is in Chrome 
                <br>- Just enjoyed myself :D
                <br>For tomorrow I'm planning to set up a MySQL database and connect it to the form so I can store the data.
                Hmmm, I might need to re-visit the PHP course for that... That's the problem with new knowledge, you need to keep adressing it to store it in your own memorybanks :P
                Am I that different from a harddrive?.... whoo almost got distracted by a philosophical path....

            <br>Day 8:\user\Bernard&gt;ListDay.exe /p 
            <br>
            <br>Listing of today: Nieuwe dag, nieuwe uitdagingen...
            <br>Ik wil nu iig voor de tekst formatting alleen nog maar gebruik maken van HTML/CSS. 
            Dit zodat ik gewoon door kan typen wat ik wil. 
            En dit zonder opmaak in de tekst zelf dus, zodat alles netjes vanzelf in het juiste format etc. afgebeeld wordt.
            <br>Ow wait, this is suppost to be in english.. Well I was just rambling about the fact that I want to use CSS for all 
            of the text formatting. For cleaner coding :)_
            <br>And placed the banner my daugher made.

            <h3>Day 7/100:</h3>
                <p>Whoohoo, first week :P
                <br>Just following along the course and some tutorials... again... 
                <br><img style="float:left" width="200" src="./Images/work.jpg">played around with linking documents and making tables in HTML.
                <br>Used stylesheet to format the table.
                <br>Ow yeah figured out how to wrap text, so here it is again: it's "honest work".
                <br>Ow... not realy working... lol.... back to the drawingboard tomorrow.. can't win them all in one go :D
                <br>No major update to the site, just some fixes. Made the tables in a seperate HTML doc.
                <br>

            <h3>Day 6/100:</h3>
                <p>New week, freshly motivated :D
                Just following along the course and some tutorials. 
                <br>Figured out how to add an image and how to make it scale to the size of the window.
                And yeah it's ugly, but it's "honest work".<br><img width="200" src="./Images/work.jpg"> 
                <br>I'll let one of my daughters draw some awesome original art.
                And It's clear I need to figure out how to wrap text around an image.
                </p>

            <h3>Day 5/100:</h3>
            <p>Had problems with centering text. p {text-align: center;} Worked for the first paragraph but only for the first...
                <br>Ow... fixed it :P, forgot to define each day as a paragraph, the second paragraph was almost the
                <br>complete page.. Got to step up my clean code....
                <br>I'm gonne leave day 1 to 4 "as is" for reference(until I figured out how to put it al in a database)
                <br>Last time I did something with HTML was like 14 years ago, CSS replaced a lot of the HTML code.
                <br>
                <br>Visited one of my friends yesterday, and he helped me with some code related questions I had.
                <br>Public thanks for that Joop :D
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Day 4/100:</h3>
            Interrupted the HTML Fundamentals training to give priority to GIT training
            <br />I've used GitHub before but I need to understand it better and being able to
            <br>restore a previous version..... Let's say that some of us need to learn the
            <br />hard way....
            <br />
            
            <h3>Day 3/100:</h3>
            Started the "HTML fundamentals" training on Pluralsight.com
            <br />Added the progress bar
            <br />Hmmm... maybe I can eventually add the tweets to this page or record
            <br />my progress log in a database or something :P
            <br />Ow and I discovered Bootstrap and wasted a couple of minutes :D
            
            <h3>Day 2/100:</h3>
            Nothing to special yet:
            <br />- selected a web hosting company (which took more time than expected)
            <br />- registered 038coder.nl
            <br />- used Visual Studio for HTML for the first time LoL.
            <br />- uploaded this HTML document to the server... Impressive huh ?!
            
            <h3>Day 1/100:</h3>
            Decided my course: from HTML,CSS&JavaScript to (OOP) PHP and finishing with Laravel.
            <br />Preparing my workstation by (re-)installing LAMP stack etc.
            <br>And hereby committing to #100DaysOfCode !!
